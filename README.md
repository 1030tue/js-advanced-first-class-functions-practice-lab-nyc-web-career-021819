## Objectives
1. Practice using forEach
2. Practice using sort
3. Practice using reduce

## Overview

## Instructions

Be sure to run the tests to get a feel for the types of problems this lab is
asking you to solve.

You'll be writing four functions:

 * `logDriverNames`- Receives an array of `driver` objects, and logs the `name` attribute of each `driver` to the console.
 * `logDriversByHometown` - Receives an array of `driver` objects as the first argument, and a location as the second argument.  The function logs to the console the `name` attribute of each `driver` whose hometown matches the string passed through as an argument.
 * `driversByRevenue` - Receives an array of `driver` objects and returns an array of `driver` objects sorted by their `revenue` attributes from lowest to highest.
 * `driversByName` - Receives an array of `driver` objects and returns an array of `driver` objects sorted by their `name` attributes from A to Z.  Here, you may have to use the `localeCompare` method.  
 * `totalRevenue` - Receives an array of `driver` objects and returns a number that is the sum of the revenue earned by each driver.
 * `averageRevenue` - Receives an array of `driver` objects and returns a number that is the average of the revenue earned by each driver.
